      <h1>Protein Translation</h1>
      <h2>Introduction and Explanation</h2>
      <p>RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptides. Here is an example, say you are given the following RNA sequence "AUGUUUUCU" it can be translated to the following codons "AUG", "UUU", "UCU". These codons can then become a polypeptide with the following proten sequence "Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine". There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids. However, there are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.</p>
      <p>The stop codons terminate the translation and the final protein is not translated into the protein sequence.</p>
